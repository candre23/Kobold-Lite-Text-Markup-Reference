## Lists
Simple bullet point lists can be generated by prepending each line with `* `.  Numbered lists require a `1. `.

## Code Blocks
Sticking three backticks above and below a series of lines will turn those lines into a raw code block.

Smaller sections within a line can be designated as code by using a single backtick on either end of the string.

## Raw HTML
Prepending a line with 4 or more spaces (or a TAB) will display the raw HTML markup what the UI would normally render.
